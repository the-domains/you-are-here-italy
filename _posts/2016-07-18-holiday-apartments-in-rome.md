The apartment is just a few minutes from the Colosseum, in the heart of Rome and the historic center. It has 2 rooms, and normally guests have the full apartment for their use. We can have up to 6 guests total. There is a baby bed available as well.   
  
This newly renovated apartment is located on the third floor of an ancient palazzo building and has an elevator. Down the cobblestone street we can see the Colosseum, and attractions, shops and restaurants are just minutes away.   
  
The kitchen is equipped with pots and cutlery, and has an oven, microwave and washing machine.   
  
In the living room area you can find a sofa with a TV, dvd and FREE WIFI. The windows are facing towards the inside court, so away from any possible street noise.   
  
The 2 bedrooms are arranged as follows:   
  
Master bedroom, with king sized bed, and plenty of closet storage space for your belongings.   
  
The smaller room, has a normal queen size bed, plus a queen size LOFT bed. Also, there is a small desk in the room.   
  
Linens and towels are included in the rate.   
  
In the bathroom, there is a shower/bath combination, fresh towels and other amenities and a laundry machine if needed (dryers are not so common in Italy, but there is a drying line available).   
  
Please contact me if you have any further questions regarding the bed disposition.   
  
You can easily reach the apartment by public transportation (Metro or bus), or with a quick taxi ride from the station. I can also help arrange a licensed driver to pick you up at the airport.   
Please inquire for details and rates.   
  
Our goal is not only to give you a clean, modern place for you to enjoy during your stay, but also advice on sightseeing, food and restaurants, bookings and more.
